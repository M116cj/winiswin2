@OPTIMIZATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

We need to perform a **Critical Stability Fix** based on the runtime logs. The system is suffering from WebSocket timeouts, JSON corruption, and excessive log noise.

Please execute the following 4-step repair plan:

### 1. Fix WebSocket "Keepalive Timeout" (Anti-Blocking)
The error `sent 1011 (internal error) keepalive ping timeout` indicates the event loop is blocked or the timeout is too strict for Railway's network.
*   **Action**: Modify `src/core/websocket/optimized_base_feed.py` (and `kline_feed.py` / `price_feed.py` if applicable).
*   **Changes**:
    *   Increase `ping_interval` to `20` seconds (was likely default 20).
    *   Increase `ping_timeout` to `30` seconds (give it more time to respond).
    *   **Crucial**: Ensure the `on_message` processing is truly async. If there are heavy calculations, wrap them in `await loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)` to avoid blocking the heartbeat.

### 2. Fix "Expecting value: line 1 column 1" (Corrupted JSON)
The `model_initializer` is crashing when reading empty JSON files.
*   **Action**: Update `src/core/model_initializer.py`.
*   **Changes**:
    *   Wrap the JSON reading logic (e.g., `json.load`) in a `try...except` block.
    *   Catch `json.JSONDecodeError` and `FileNotFoundError`.
    *   If caught, return a safe default value (e.g., `0` samples) instead of crashing/logging an error.
    *   Implement a "Safe Write" method that writes to a `.tmp` file first, then renames it to the target file to prevent corruption during crashes.

### 3. Silence the Scheduler Log Noise
The logs are flooded with "Confidence 0.0% | Rejected".
*   **Action**: Update `src/core/unified_scheduler.py`.
*   **Changes**:
    *   In the signal analysis loop, **change the log level** of the rejection messages.
    *   **Logic**:
        *   If `confidence > 0` or `win_rate > 0`: Keep logging as `INFO`.
        *   If `confidence == 0` AND `win_rate == 0`: Change log level to `DEBUG` (so it doesn't show in standard production logs).
    *   Remove the "Signal Analysis Diagnostics (Top 10)" table printing if all top 10 have 0 confidence.

### 4. Fix "0.0ms Analysis Skip"
This is a symptom of empty data caused by the WebSocket issues.
*   **Action**: Update `src/core/unified_scheduler.py`.
*   **Changes**:
    *   Before calling the strategy, check if the data exists.
    *   If `df is None` or `df.empty`, log a **single** warning "Waiting for market data..." and `continue` the loop, instead of running the full analysis pipeline and reporting "0.0ms execution".

**Execute these fixes immediately.**
