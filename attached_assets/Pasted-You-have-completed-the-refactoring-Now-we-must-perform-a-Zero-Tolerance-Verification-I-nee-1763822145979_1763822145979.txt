You have completed the refactoring. Now, we must perform a **"Zero Tolerance" Verification**. 
I need to ensure there are absolutely NO leftovers, NO broken imports, and NO "blind spots" missed during the rewrite.

**Your Mission:** 
Create and execute a diagnostic script `verify_refactor.py` to audit the entire `src/` directory programmatically.

### 🛠️ STEP 1: Create the Verification Script (`verify_refactor.py`)
Write a Python script that performs the following checks:

1.  **The "Forbidden Imports" Check**:
    -   Walk through every `.py` file in `src/`.
    -   Fail if any file contains: `from src.config`, `import src.config`, `ConfigProfile`, `src.database.async_manager`.
    -   *Goal:* Ensure deleted modules are truly dead to the system.

2.  **The "Hidden Configuration" Check**:
    -   Fail if any file (except `unified_config.py`) contains `os.getenv(` or `os.environ[`.
    -   *Goal:* Ensure `UnifiedConfig` is the ONLY place reading environment variables.

3.  **The "Async Hygiene" Check**:
    -   Fail if any file containing `async def` also contains `time.sleep(` or `open(`.
    -   *Goal:* Ensure we didn't miss any blocking calls in async functions.

4.  **The "Import Integrity" Test (Dry Run)**:
    -   Try to `from src.core.unified_config import config`.
    -   Try to `from src.database.unified_db import UnifiedDatabaseManager`.
    -   Catch `ImportError` or `AttributeError`.
    -   *Goal:* Ensure the new files are syntax-error free and importable.

5.  **The "Entry Point" Check**:
    -   Read `main.py` (or `run.py`).
    -   Verify string existence: `UnifiedDatabaseManager.initialize()` and `UnifiedDatabaseManager.close()`.

### 🛠️ STEP 2: Execute & Fix
1.  **Run** this script inside the environment.
2.  **Report** the results.
3.  **IMMEDIATELY FIX** any files that fail the verification.
    -   If a file still imports `src.config`, change it to `src.core.unified_config`.
    -   If a file has `time.sleep`, change it to `await asyncio.sleep`.
    -   If `main.py` is missing initialization, add it.

**Start by creating and running the verification script now.**
