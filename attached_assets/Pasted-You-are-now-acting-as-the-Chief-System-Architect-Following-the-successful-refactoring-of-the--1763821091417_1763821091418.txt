You are now acting as the **Chief System Architect**. 

Following the successful refactoring of the WebSocket module (where we fixed a "Multiple Truths" antipattern), I suspect similar architectural rot exists elsewhere in the codebase.

**Your Mission:**
Perform a comprehensive **Structural Integrity Audit** of the entire `src/` directory. Identify any architectural inconsistencies, redundant mechanisms, or "Split Brain" logic (where two components try to do the same job).

### 🔍 AUDIT CRITERIA (What to search for):

1.  **Configuration Chaos:**
    *   Are we mixing `os.getenv`, `argparse`, and a `Config` class? 
    *   *Goal:* Verify there is a **Single Source of Truth** for settings.

2.  **Database/State Management Conflicts:**
    *   Are there multiple ways we connect to the Database or Redis? (e.g., raw `aioredis` in one place, a wrapper class in another).
    *   Are we mixing local variables and external caches for the same data?

3.  **Async/Threading Violations:**
    *   Apart from the WebSockets, are there other places where we mix `threading` with `asyncio` dangerously?
    *   Are there blocking calls (like `requests` or `time.sleep`) inside `async` functions?

4.  **Logging Fragmentation:**
    *   Are we using `print()`, `logging.info()`, and custom `Logger` wrappers inconsistently?
    *   *Goal:* Ensure one unified logging format across the system.

5.  **Zombie/Duplicate Logic:**
    *   Are there "Base" classes that are barely used or bypassed by subclasses (like the old `BaseFeed`)?
    *   Are there files that look like "v1" and "v2" existing simultaneously?

### 🛠️ EXECUTION PLAN (Step-by-Step):

**Phase 1: The Diagnostic Report**
First, scan the codebase and output a **Markdown Report** summarizing the issues found. Use this format:

> **Found Issue**: [Component Name]
> **Severity**: [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM]
> **Description**: [Explain why this is structurally confused]
> **Refactoring Proposal**: [How to unify it]

**Phase 2: The Refactoring Directive**
If (and only if) you find **CRITICAL** or **HIGH** severity issues (like multiple config loaders or blocking code in async loops):
1.  **Propose** the specific code changes.
2.  **Create/Refactor** a "Manager" or "Base" class to unify the logic (just like we did with `UnifiedWebSocketFeed`).
3.  **Update** the dependent modules to use the new unified structure.

**⚠️ SAFETY RULES:**
*   **DO NOT** change business logic (trading algorithms, strategies). Only change *how* they connect/run.
*   **DO NOT** delete files unless you are 100% sure they are unused. Mark them as `DEPRECATED` first.

**Start your audit now. Report your findings first.**
