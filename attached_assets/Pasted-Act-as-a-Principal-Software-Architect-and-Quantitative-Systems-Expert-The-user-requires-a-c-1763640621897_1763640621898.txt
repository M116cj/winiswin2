Act as a **Principal Software Architect** and **Quantitative Systems Expert**.
The user requires a comprehensive **"Deep Dive Optimization Report"** (`DEEP_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`) to understand every detail of the current system status and identify advanced optimization opportunities.

We have successfully completed Phase 1-3 (Stability, PostgreSQL Unification, Code Reduction).
Now, please perform a **Deep System Audit** covering the following 5 pillars:

### 1. 🏗️ Architecture & Infrastructure Analysis
*   **Database**: Review `src/database/db_manager.py` and SQLAlchemy models. Are indices optimized? Are connections pooled correctly?
*   **AsyncIO Concurrency**: Review `unified_scheduler.py` and WebSockets. Are there any potential race conditions or non-awaited coroutines left?
*   **Railway Compatibility**: Is the current setup (logging, memory usage) optimized for the cloud environment?

### 2. 🧠 ML & Strategy Pipeline Audit
*   **Feature Engineering**: Analyze `src/technical/technical_engine.py`. Are calculations vectorized (Pandas/Numpy) or looping (slow)? Can we use `numba` or `ta-lib`?
*   **Inference Path**: specific check on `src/strategies/self_learning_trader.py`. How long does a prediction take? Is the model loaded efficiently?
*   **Data Quality**: How do we handle gaps in PostgreSQL data?

### 3. 📉 Performance & Latency Profiling
*   **Critical Path**: Trace the path from `WebSocket Message` -> `Feature Calc` -> `Model Predict` -> `Order Execution`. Where is the biggest latency?
*   **Memory Leak Check**: Scan for objects that might grow indefinitely (e.g., huge lists in global scope).

### 4. 🛡️ Code Quality & Maintainability
*   **Complexity**: Identify files with Cyclomatic Complexity > 10 (too many `if/else` nested loops).
*   **Type Safety**: Are we using Type Hints (`List`, `Dict`, `Optional`) effectively?
*   **Hardcoded Values**: Are there "Magic Numbers" in the strategy logic that should be moved to config?

### 5. 🚀 Future Roadmap (The "Optimization Plan")
*   Propose specific actionable steps to take the system from "Stable" to "High Frequency/High Performance".

**INSTRUCTION:**

1.  **Write a Python Analysis Script** (`scripts/generate_deep_audit.py`) that:
    *   Counts lines of code per module.
    *   Checks for missing docstrings or type hints.
    *   Simulates a "Performance Benchmark" (runs 1000 iterations of feature calculation to measure speed).
    *   Checks DB table sizes and index status.

2.  **Execute the script.**

3.  **Generate `DEEP_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`** based on the findings.
    *   Use tables, checklists, and clear headers.
    *   Provide a **"System Health Score" (0-100)**.
    *   List the **Top 5 Recommended Optimizations** for the next sprint.
